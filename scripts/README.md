h3.CAT (_cat) API

In Elasticsearch, _cat is short for "Compact and Aligned Text". The CAT API is designed to provide a concise and human-readable overview of various cluster, node, and index metrics. It offers a quick and easy way to get information about an Elasticsearch cluster in a format that's easy to read and understand, making it particularly useful for administrators and developers who need to quickly check the status of their Elasticsearch deployment.

The CAT API returns plain text instead of the traditional JSON format, which makes it ideal for use in the command line or Kibana console. It's important to note that while the CAT API is excellent for human consumption and quick checks, it is not intended for use by applications.
